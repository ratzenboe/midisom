# Midisom

Self Organizing Maps
--------------------

Midisom is a a fork to the [MiniSom](https://github.com/JustGlowing/minisom) package which is a minimalistic and Numpy based implementation of the Self Organizing Maps (SOM) 
created by Giuseppe Vettigli. 
The Midisom package adds minor extensions such as the [tqdm](https://tqdm.github.io/) status bar for training the SOM and also adds multiple plotting member function for easy, convenient, and fast
results.

Installation
---------------------

Download MidiSom to a directory of your choice via
```
  git clone https://github.com/ratzenboe/midisom
```
change into the created directory and execute the setup script

```
  python setup.py install
```

How to use it
---------------------

In constrast to the original Minisom package Midisom works with `pandas` DataFrames as well as with `numpy` arrays. The newly added plotting functions in fact currently rely on 
the input data to be `pandas` DataFrames. 

```python
from midisom import MidiSom    
som = MidiSom(20, 20, df_data.shape[-1], sigma=2.0, learning_rate=0.5) # initialization of 20x20 SOM
q_error,iter_x = som.train_error(df_data, init=True, rand=True, err_update=df_data.shape[0]//100) # trains the SOM and calculates the quantisation error 100 times

# plotting the quantisation error
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
plt.plot(iter_x, q_error)

# Plotting the distance map (if target is available, else target=None)
som.plot_distance_map(df_data, target, n_samples=-1) # plots all n_samples onto the som grid - this may take a while (value should be below 10^5 for sensible run times); for unsupervised: target=None
# Plotting the individual feature distributions
som.plot_feat_dist(df_data)
# Plotting the most important features per cell 
som.plot_most_imp_feat(df_data)
# (Supervised) Plotting a map where the individual classes have landed
som.plot_label_map(df_data, target)
# Plotting activation response (count where the most instances lie)
som.plot_activation_response(df_data, target, n_samples=-1) # for unsupervised: target=None
```
